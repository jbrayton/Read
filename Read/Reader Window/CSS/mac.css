    The two elements below prevent the scroll view on macOS from having horizontal
    elasticity when scrolling. On iOS, a previous version of this seemed to mess up determining the location on screen
    (within the scrolled area) at which an image is located. Might be ok with this version, I don't know. But for now it's
    macOS-only.
